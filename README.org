* XXX

This repository contains the source code of XXX.

* Setup

XXX requires anaconda / miniconda, available from [[https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html][here]].

#+begin_src
git clone https://github.com/guicho271828/XXX.git
cd XXX
source install.sh
#+end_src

=./install.sh= or =(ba)sh ./install.sh= does not work; =source install.sh= is necessary.
The script downloads dependencies outside pip and conda too.
